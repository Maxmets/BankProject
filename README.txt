This BankProject was a summer project in 2018, to grasp the concepts that I learned during first year 
of computer science at University level. I want to continue working on it again, as I think there are multiple improvements
I can make. Those improvements would allow me to learn new concepts such as using ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream to store 
objects in textfiles, and then later call them, during the programs next execution.


Future Improvements: 

1. Update the login system so that it can store more than one person logging in. 
2. Add new feature to transfer "money" between users. (possibly using ObjectInput and ObjectOutput streams)
3. Update the UI to feature a mock bank logo, and better looking buttons,textareas,and textfields.
